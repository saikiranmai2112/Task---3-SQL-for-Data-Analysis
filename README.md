# Task---3-SQL-for-Data-Analysis

This project showcases SQL-based analysis on a sample eCommerce database. The goal is to demonstrate structured data querying and analytical thinking using SQL.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `setup.sql` – SQL script to create and populate the database
- `queries.sql` – SQL queries written for analysis
- 'Screenshot' of  outputs
- `README.md` – This file

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`
- Subqueries
- Views
- Query optimization strategies

## 📊 Analyses Performed

### 1. Revenue Per User

### 4. Monthly Sales Trend
Shows how revenue fluctuates month-to-month.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Use any SQL client (MySQL, SQLite, or PostgreSQL)
2. Run `setup.sql` to create and populate tables
3. Run queries from `queries.sql`
4. Take screenshots of results for documentation
